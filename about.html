							My Adventure
						</h1>
						<p class="lead">
							I am a web developer because I enjoy learning and
							wanted to combine it with my love of computers. I am
							a graduate of CareerFoundry's intensive
							career-changers UI Program with a specialization in
							animation, as well as multiple courses for HTML,
							CSS, Javascript, and more. See my
							<a
								href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharonherrmann/"
								>LinkedIn Profile</a
							>
							for specific classes, certifications, and skills.
							<br />
							<br />

							In the past, I have been a Subject Matter Expert in
							Comcast's Technician Center of Excellence. While
							assisting technicians, I routinely located pain
							points and created or provided ideas for processes
							to improve the customer and employee experience. My
							team and I was awarded Comcast's ACE Award for
							upgrading our department's knowledgebase to the
							newest Microsoft Sharepoint version. This change
							increased agent usability & integrity with better
							design and complete, accurate information, while
							paving the way for additional features to be
							introduced in the future.
							<br />
							In an effort to ensure the knowledgebase stayed true
							to these efforts, a style sheet and guide were
							created to ensure future editors adhered to the
							standards that were created.
							<br />
							In addition, I increased the customer experience by
							self-teaching new programs to create a ticketing
							tracker to improve how we handle escalated service
							issues, and iterated upon it to improve the agent
							experience further (reducing call handle time by 10
							minutes).

							<br />
							<br />

							Peers love to work with me because I bring solutions
							and ideas to the table, act with integrity, and get
							the job done. I listen to others and consider all
							points and sides of the story. I can also bring a
							sense of humor and playfulness, because all work and
							no play leads to employee turnover. I am open to
							work in remote roles. I continue to refine my
							technique and increase my skillset every day, and am
							taking additional courses for design and development
							on multiple platforms. Any recommendation in
							courses, YouTube channels, and reading is welcome!

							<br />
							<br />

							Outside of pursuing a career-change, I love to read
							books and explore the wilderness. I am a mother of
							two children, whom I take camping every year and
							search for new adventures with. If there's anything
							else you'd like to know or would like to connect,
							send me a message! I am an open book and I love to
							get to know people.
